\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Shortcomings}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Some of the algorithms are really slow. If your program has many operations in it, then it becomes ineffiecient.
	\item Each float Division takes nearly 1.5s.
	\item Most operations are written with pass-by-copy.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Verification}
The code has been verified using python scripts.

\subsection{Learnings}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Version Control Using Git.
	\item Library creation and usage.
	\item Efficient Debugging.
\end{enumerate}
