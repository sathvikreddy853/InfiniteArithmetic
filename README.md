# Infinite Precision Arithmetic Library

This library is made to accomodate numbers of infinite length. 

It can do all of the regular operations like add, subtract, multiply, divide and mod.

#### Using The Library

The library contains two header files - one for integers and the other for floating point numbers.

Simply include the files by using `#include "Integer.h"` or `#include "Float.h"` or both depending on your requirement.

## Integer
Here's a briefing of the utilities in `Integer.h`

Note: Provision can be added to add and sub

| Functions | Purpose | 
| --------- | --------- |
| Add | adds two numbers together | 
| Subtract | subtracts one number from the other | 
| Multiply | multiplies two numbers | 
| Divide | divides two numbers |
| Complement | Takes the complement of given number | 

## Float
And here are the directions to use `Float.h`
