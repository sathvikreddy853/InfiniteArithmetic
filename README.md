# Infinite Arithmetic Library

This library is made to accomodate numbers of infinite length. 

It can do all of the regular operations like add, subtract, multiply, divide and mod.

#### Using The Library

The library contains two header files - one for integers and the other for floating point numbers.

Simply include the files by using `#include "Integer.h"` or `#include "Float.h"` or both depending on your requirement.

## Integer
