# Infinite Precision Arithmetic Library

This library is made to accomodate numbers of infinite length. 

It can do all of the regular operations like add, subtract, multiply, divide and mod.

#### Using The Library

The library contains two header files - one for integers and the other for floating point numbers.

Simply include the files by using `#include "Integer.h"` or `#include "Float.h"` or both depending on your requirement.

## Integer
Here's a briefing of the utilities in `Integer.h`

<!-- Note: Provision can be added to add and sub -->

| Functions | Purpose | 
| --------- | --------- |
| Print | Displays the number |
| Assign | Used to assign the object to another value |
| Add | Adds two numbers together | 
| Subtract | Subtracts one number from the other | 
| Multiply | Multiplies two numbers | 
| Divide | Divides two numbers | 
| Complement | Takes the complement of given number | 
| PopZero | Removes redundant zeroes from the number | 
| MatchDigits | Matches the digits of two numbers such that they are equal |

| Operators | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| operator<< | Used to display the number (output the number) |
| operator= | Used to assign the object to another value | 
| operator+ | Adds two numbers |
| operatorâ€“ | Subtracts one number from the other |
| operator* | Multiplies two numbers |
| operator/ | Divides one number by the other |

## Float
And here are the directions to use `Float.h`
